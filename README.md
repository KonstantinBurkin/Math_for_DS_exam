# "Math for Data Science" exam
This is my exam project for course "The introduction course to math for data science", MSU Fall 2021 - Spring 2022. 

The program of the course is [here](https://github.com/MSUcourses/Data-Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Math) or [here](https://github.com/amkatrutsa/msu_intro_ds2021).

In this exam I solve 4 problems describing convergence of 4 iterative root-finding algorithms:
- Gradient descent
- Heavy ball descent
- Accelerated gradient descent
- Newton's method

Created in March 2022.
