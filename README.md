# Optimisation algorithms
  
## Task description
My exam project for MSU course "The introduction course to math for data science", Fall 2021 - Spring 2022. 
The program of the course can be found [here](https://github.com/MSUcourses/Data-Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Math) or [here](https://github.com/amkatrutsa/msu_intro_ds2021). Exam consists of 4 problems describing convergence of 4 iterative optimisation algorithms using the example of function minimisation. Optimisation algorithms include: Gradient descent, Heavy ball descent, Accelerated gradient descent, Newton's method.

  
  
## Files:  
- **Optimisation_algorithms.ipynb** - The description of the problem, initial conditions, solution, and visual answer.
- **Optimisation_algorithms_supplementary.ipynb** - Additional code needed to convert the notebook to html.  
   
   
 Created by the end of March, 2022.
